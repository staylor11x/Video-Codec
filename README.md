# Video-Codec
EN5502 MEng Coursework for video encoding and decoding.


This code is designed to show how a video coding algorithm is implemented from the ground up, I am aware that it is horrifically inefficient and should under no circumstances ever be used, ever.

The basic Process is:

- Feed in video sequence
- Perform motion compensation
- Take DCT of frame
- Quantize frame
- Encode and save to file (Optional and unfinished)
- Inverse Quantize frame
- Take IDCT of frame
- Perform motion compensation on reconstructed frame

Done! You will have ruined a perfectly good video...

Never got to fully finish the algorithm as it doesnâ€™t properly decode the binary information fully. It is incredible to see how much space can be saved with some simple compression however!
